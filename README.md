BPMN MIWG Demos
===============

This repository contains demo applications build by the [BPMN 2.0 Model Interchange Working Group (MIWG)](http://www.omgwiki.org/bpmn-miwg/)
for a specific event (like a conference or an OMG Technical Meeting). Have a look at the [branches](https://github.com/bpmn-miwg/bpmn-miwg-demos/branches) for intermediate results.

Note: They are only tested manually and not actively maintained.
